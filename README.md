# community
Decentralized deployment of custodial LN wallets

Idea

Alice installs the community plugin on her LN node and Bob connects to it with a browser plugin, desktop app or what have you and is able to send and recieve sats using liquidity that Alice manages. 

This way fewer people have to manage liquidity and the costs associtated with managing liqiudity can be spread out among more users. Ideally community will be plug and play, it should be easy for anyone to become a custodian and gain users, which would lead to a more decentralized network.
