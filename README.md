Decentralized deployment of custodial LN wallets

Idea

Alice installs the community plugin on her LN node and Bob connects to it with a a browswer plugin, desktopp app or what have you and is able to send and recieve sats using liquidity that Alice has set up. This way everyone doesent have to manage liquidity and the costs of doing so could be socialized but also everyone wont end up using the same custodian.
